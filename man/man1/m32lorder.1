The standard output
is a list of pairs of object file names
meaning that the first file of the pair refers to
external identifiers defined in the second.
The output may be processed by
.IR tsort (1)
to find an ordering of
a library suitable for one-pass access by
.IR \*pld .

The following example builds a new library
from existing
.B \&. o
files.

contained in library archives, are overlooked.
Their global symbols and references are attributed to
some other file.
