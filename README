This 5620 DMD host development package works on both Suns and System V.
First install the pseudo-tty based layers into your chosen $DMD directory,
and install this package on top of it into the same target directory. 
If you plan to use xcip, xproof, or some other tools that need troff fonts,
you will also want to install the lib/xfont files from the tc630 package
into $DMD/font.

To compile and install this package, use

	make DMD=<your chosen install directory> install

Much of the package can be moved to a different install directory without
recompiling by simply setting the 'DMD' environment variable to point to
the new directory, but not all of the Software Generation System is 
guaranteed to work if you do that.

P.S. The 'dmdebug' directory was added on 6/11/96 but not included in the
     top level makefile.  You're on your own to build it.
